# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration

## Dataset

The GoBike dataset contains the information of the individuals rides through San Francisco Bay area during the period from 2017 - 2020. The dataset contains information like the trip duration and start and end time.  It also contains information regarding the types of individuals and the start and end location.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that it makes sense that there are more subscribers than customers pricing. During the day, there are more trips in the morning and afternoon than the night. Also, after separation the top 5 stations, half of stations have the most trips in the morning and another half of stations have the most trips in the afternoon.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on duration and how long the trip takes and users. I start by introducing a duration trip, followed by users type. Also, how long users take to finish the trip.
